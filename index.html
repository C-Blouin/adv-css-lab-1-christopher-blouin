          <q>Boiler plate</q> originally referred to the maker's label used to

        <p>
          In the field of printing, the term dates back to the early 1900s. From
          the 1890s onwards, printing plates of text for widespread reproduction
          such as advertisements or syndicated columns were cast or stamped in
          steel (instead of the much softer and less durable lead alloys used
          otherwise) ready for the printing press and distributed to newspapers
          around the United States. By analogy, they came to be known as
          <q>boilerplates</q>. One large supplier to newspapers of this kind of
          boilerplate was the Western Newspaper Union, which supplied
          "ready-to-print stories [which] contained national or international
          news" to papers with smaller geographic footprints, which could
          include advertisements pre-printed next to the conventional content.<a
            href="#"
            >[2]</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Some companies also sent out press releases as boilerplate so that
          they had to be printed as written. The modern equivalent is the press
          release boilerplate, or <q>boiler,</q> a paragraph or two that
          describes the company and its products.

            In contractual law, the term <q>boilerplate language</q> describes
            the parts of a contract that are considered standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Boilerplate language may also exist in pre-created form letters on
            the Internet for such things as issues to be broached by a
            politician based on an issue ad, requests that a cable or satellite
            operator add a cable network to a system, pre-written complaints
            about a product that is opposed by groups that create such letters,
            or online petitions. The person requesting the action usually only
            needs to type or sign his or her name at the end of the pre-written
            greeting and body.

          <h3>Boilerplate Code</h3>
          <p>
            In computer programming, boilerplate is the sections of code that
            have to be included in many places with little or no alteration.
            Such boilerplate is particularly salient when the programmer must
            include a lot of code for minimal functionality. The need for
            boilerplate can be reduced through high-level mechanisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            A related phenomenon, bookkeeping code, is code that is not part of
            the business logic but is interleaved with it in order to keep data
            structures updated or able to handle secondary aspects of the
            program.
